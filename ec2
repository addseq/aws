EC2 Overview
  Resizable Compute Capacity
EC2 Pricing Models
  On Demand
    Pay fixed rate per hour with no upfront costs or commitment
    Low cost and flexible
    Apps with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
    Apps being developed or tested for first time
  Reserved
    Provide capacity reservation, offer significant discount on hourly charge for instance. 1 or 3 Yr terms
    Apps with steady state or predictable usage that require reserved capacity
    Larger upfront payments reduces total computing costs further
  Spot
    Bid for price on excess compute capacity
    Apps that have flexible start and end times
    Apps that are only feasible at very low compute prices
    Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity
    If spot instance terminated by AWS (Spot Price > Bid Price), you will not be charged for partial hour of usage.
    However if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for partial hours
  Dedicated Hosts
    Physical EC2 server. Reduce costs by allowing use of existing server-bound software licenses.
    Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualisation
    Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
    Purchased hourly on-demand or upfront for 70% off
EC2 Instance Types
  D2 - Density storage, fileservers/data warehouse/hadoop
  R4 - Memory optimized, memory intensive apps/dbs
  M4 - General purpose, app servers
  C4 - Compute optimized, cpu intensive apps/dbs
  G2 - Graphics intensive, video encoding/3d app streaming
  I2 - IOPS high speed storage, nosql dbs/data warehousing
  F1 - Field programmable gate array (FPGA), hardware acceleration for code
  T2 - Lowest cost & cheap general purpose, web servers/small dbs
  P2 - Graphics/general purpose GPU, maching learning/bit coin mining
  X1 - Extreme Memory optimized, apache spark
EBS
  Create storage volumes and attach to EC2
  Can create FS on top of these volumes, run a database, or use in any other way as a block device
  Placed in specific availability zones and automatically replicated
EBS Volume Types
  SSD General Purpose (GP2) - Balance price and performance. 3 IOPS per GB up to 10K IOPS and ability to burst up to 3K IOPS under 1 Gib
  SSD Provisioned IOPS (IO1) - Use if need > 10K IOPS, up to 20K IOPS. Designed for I/O intensive apps such as NoSQL or large RDBs
  HDD Throughput Optimized (ST1) - Use for frequently accessed worklads. Big data, data warehouse, log process, cannot be a boot volume
  HDD Cold (SC1) - Lowest cost storage for infrequent workloads such as file server
  HDD Magnetic (Standard) - Lowest cost per GB of all EBS that is bootable. Cheap, infrequently acccessed workloads with lowest storage cost
  You cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS
