Overview
  Resizable Compute Capacity
Pricing Models
  On Demand
    Pay fixed rate per hour with no upfront costs or commitment
    Low cost and flexible
    Apps with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
    Apps being developed or tested for first time
  Reserved
    Provide capacity reservation, offer significant discount on hourly charge for instance. 1 or 3 Yr terms
    Apps with steady state or predictable usage that require reserved capacity
    Larger upfront payments reduces total computing costs further
  Spot
    Bid for price on excess compute capacity
    Apps that have flexible start and end times
    Apps that are only feasible at very low compute prices
    Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity
  Dedicated Hosts
    Physical EC2 server. Reduce costs by allowing use of existing server-bound software licenses.
    Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualisation
    Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
    Purchased hourly on-demand or upfront for 70% off
    If spot instance terminated (Spot Price > Bid Price), you will not be charged for partial hour of usage.
    However if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for partial hours
