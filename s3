S3 Overview
  Object based storage
  Consists of Key (name), Value (data), VersionID, Metadata
  Object based storage only for files, not suitable for OS installs
  Files are 0 - 5TB
  Unlimited storage
  Files are stored in Buckets
  S3 is universal namespace, bucket names must be unique e.g. https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/{bucketname}
  Read after Write consistency for PUTS
  Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS (updates) or DELETES, can take some time
S3 Storage Tiers
  S3: 11 9's of durability, 99.99% availability, immediately available, frequent access
  S3-IA: 11 9's of durability, 99.9% availability, immediately available, infrequent access
  S3 RRS: 99.99% durability, 99.99% availability, easily reproducible objects i.e. thumbnails
  Glacier: 11 9's of durability, 99.99% availability, archived data, takes 3-5 hours for access. 
Versioning
  Stores all versions of objects, even if you delete object
  Once enabled, cannot be disabled, can only be suspended
  Integrates with lifecycle rules
  MFA Delete can be used to provide additional security layer
  Cross region replication requires versioning enabled on source bucket
Lifecylce Management
  Used with current versions or previous versions
  S3 -> S3-IA transition can be done with minimum 128KB data 30 days after creation
  S3-IA -> Glacier transition can be done 30 days after S3-IA 
  Permanently delete objects
CloudFront
  Edge Location - Where content will be cached, about 50 globally currently. Both READ/WRITE supported (store objects)
  Origin - Origin of all files that CDN will distribute. Can be either S3, EC2, Elastic Load Balancer, or Route53
  Distribution - Name given to CDN which consists of collection of Edge Locations. Can be either Web Distribution or RTMP (flash files)
  Objects are cached for life of the TTL (Time to Live)
  Clearing cached objects from Edge Locations incur a charge
Buckets
  All newly created Buckets are PRIVATE
  Can setup Bucket Policies or Access Control Lists (ACL) to control buckets
  S3 Buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests
Enrcyption
  In Transit done via SSL/TLS
  At Rest done via Server Side Encryption: S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3), AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), Customer Provided Key (SSE-C)
  Client Side Enrcyption
Gateways
  File Gateway - For flat files only stored directly to S3
  Stored Volume Gateway - Entire dataset is stored in onsite datacenter and asynchronously backed to S3
  Cached Volume Gateway - Entire dataset is stored on S3, only most frequently accessed data cached onsite
  Gateway Virtual Tape Library (VTL) - Used for backups, uses apps like NetBackup, Backup Exec, Veam
Snowball
  Import/Export to S3
  Snowball: 50 - 80TB Storage
  Snowball Edge: Storage + Compute capabilities, can run lambda functions, like a mini-datacenter
  Snowmobile: Semitrailer truck with 100PB storage, only available in U.S. as of 2016
Other
  S3 Transfer Acceleration speeds up upload speeds in far away regions
  Can host static websites, serverless, very cheap, but only static content cannot host dynamic sites
  Write to S3 HTTP 200 code for successful write
  Use multipart upload feature to increase upload speeds
